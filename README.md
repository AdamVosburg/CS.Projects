C++ Projects & Java Projects
In these files, the first classes are built using Java and further practiced using C++.
In these projects, Computer Science principles of the four pillars are being observed.
The Java projects helped to introduce how classes operate and define/use them properly.
The challenge of C++ was using pointer references and linked lists.  These cases, including try-and-catch errors, can be displayed 
in the Airgead projects recently added.
The Grocery Tracking .cpp application shows that my coding skills are progressing in a consistent manner.
In addition, the documentation skills I have begun displaying are very helpful in understanding my methodologies regarding 
code usage as well as testing error cases.
